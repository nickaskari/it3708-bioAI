Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS)

Mutation bør kanskje kunne gjøre endringer inter-route
- Inter route swap or other types

Destroy and repair. 
- Take a cluster and destroy the route(s) connected. Then apply an algorithnm to fix it. 


Need to apply/enforce feasibility in the end. 

GA boosting:
- Local search (swapping and moving, both intra and entra)
- Paralell compution (biological aspect), let computing happen independently in different islands
- Choosing efficient data structures. 

Improving population management:
- Sometimes want to choose infeasible solutions, to investigate new areas, and turn them into feasible in the end.
     Large destroy 
- No improving?
    - keep the x best, and initialize y new individuals. To get out of local minima

Construction heuristics, initialization:
- random
- greedy - assign patient to route that increases travel time by smallest amount
- cluster-analysis. Assign nurses to clusters

Other tips:
- We have handled penalties correctly. Cannot treat time window violations as binary, need a quantitative measure 
    such that the algorithm understands which way to improve. 

Crossover:
- select random small subset of patients (preferably in a bad route), destroy it, and local seacrh to find an optimal
     route for these patients. In the slides, they didnt actually combine several individuals, it was rather a type of 
     cheeky mutation. The professor said that after this thing, one could do a more traditional crossover.
